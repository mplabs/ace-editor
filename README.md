##&lt;ace-editor&gt;

`<ace-editor>` provides a full fledged code editor with syntax hightlighting and code-completion.

In typical use, just add `<ace-editor>` in place of a plain `<textarea>`:

<form>
    <ace-editor>Some default content...</ace-editor>

Use like you would any other input-element.
